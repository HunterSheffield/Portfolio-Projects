In this project you may find my SQL code and Tableau dashboard sample. The purpose of this project is to explore the Covid-19 dataset downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus. 

In this example, we will query the data to find infection rate by country, death count by country, death rate by country, total percent vaccinated by country, and rolling percent vaccinated by country. 

The tools I'm using are Microsoft SQL Server for querying data from the dataset and Tableau for data visualization.

In Covid_SQL_Dataset, you will find all the queries that explore the dataset. 

In tableau_SQL_views, you will find all the queries that create tables for my Tableau Visualization.

You can view the dashboard I created in Tableau reflecting the queried dataset with the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hunter.sheffield/viz/CovidDashboard_16591265846130/CovidDashboard
