In this project you may find my SQL code and Tableau dashboard sample. The purpose of this project is to explore the Covid-19 dataset found . The dataset is downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus. 

In this example, we will query the data to find infection rate by country, death count by country, death rate by country, total percent vaccinated by country, and rolling percent vaccinated by country. 

The tools I'm using are Microsoft SQL Server for querying data from the dataset and Tableau for data visualization.

In Covid_SQL_Dataset to Covid_SQL_Dataset.sql, you can find all the queries that explore the dataset. The purpose of this is to understand the dataset and create a working plan.

In tableau_SQL_views, you can find all the queries that create tables for my Tableau Visualization.
